As a result, the hospitality and entertainment industry is forced to adapt and evolve for future growth. Marked by increased mergers and acquisitions activity and a high rate of new property development, industry players must meet these growing headwinds with innovative financing, debt restructuring, and partnership agreements. Meanwhile, competition among properties, brands, and service offerings and todayâ€™s economic volatility present a constant challenge for hospitality organizations, resulting in the rapid evolution of marketing efforts, digital strategies, and operational initiatives aimed at increasing customer acquisition and retention."
